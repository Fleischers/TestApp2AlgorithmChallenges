In general my Node.js experience comes down to:

 - Built web server with REST architecture using Express framework.
 - Made chat server for Unreal Engine 4 as client-side with Websockets under Socket.io framework and stored received JSON messages in MongoDB database with Mongoose.

I have not used unit testing in Node projects yet, but I started experimenting with Vows framework.

Additionaly, I am using Ubuntu, bash scripts, vim and git actively in conjunction with Node.js platform which leads me to feel comfortable with Linux Administration.
